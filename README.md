## Reflection

- I am happy to report that this assignment "seemed" slightly easier thanks to the experience from previous assignments.
  - I felt more confident in creating a interestig grid layout with inspiration from [Ghibli](https://ghiblicollection.com/) website and design.
  - This assignment all in all was really fun!
- I experimented more with `color-changing` `keyframes`... that was a lot of fun!
- I did struggle with some acpects of images height being really small when the window was smaller. However, I resolved this by adding padding to the images themselves.

### Other Notes
